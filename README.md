# Description of ROT13 and Cryptography
Cryptography secures information using various methods, and one of the simplest is ROT13. ROT13, or "rotate by 13 places," is a Caesar cipher that shifts each letter 13 places in the alphabet. For example, 'A' becomes 'N', 'B' becomes 'O', and so on. Applying ROT13 twice returns the original text.

For example, the encoded message cvpbPGS{arkg_gvzr_V'yy_gel_2_ebhaqf_bs_ebg13_GYpXOHqX} can be decrypted by applying ROT13.

While ROT13 is not suitable for serious security due to its simplicity, itâ€™s a great way to learn about basic encryption and decryption.
